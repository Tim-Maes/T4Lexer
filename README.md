# T4Lexer

This repo is a work in progress, the goal is to achieve a parser for T4 templates that can be used in [T4Editor](https://www.github.com/Tim-Maes/T4Editor).

Currently, the extension uses classifiers to colorize T4 code blocks, which are filtered out by using Regular Expressions. This is laggy and not performant, especially when working with large .tt files.
